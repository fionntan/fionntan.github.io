      <description>I heard this tune on Ian Lynch’s wonderful podcast Fire Draw Near.
Wonderful, as in, the podcast is literally full of wonders. Wonder about the songs, where they came from and how they pass through people and time. Wonder about the singers, who they are and where they got the gift of their beautiful voices. And mainly wonder how Ian keeps finding such class tunes!
I&amp;rsquo;m usually floored by at least a couple of songs on each episode.</description>
