      <description>Our great-grandfather was Louis J. Walsh. This article in the Dictionary of Irish Biography holds as much information as I know about him. He had a pretty active life. He was part of the early 20th-century Irish Republican movement, had a stint in Ballykinlar interment camp, wrote quite a bit of fiction and non-fiction and was even the first district judge appointed by the new Irish state.
My aunt recently sent me an essay he had published in The Derry Journal in 1931.</description>

      <description>I heard this tune on Ian Lynch’s wonderful podcast Fire Draw Near.
Wonderful, as in, the podcast is literally full of wonders. Wonder about the songs, where they came from and how they pass through people and time. Wonder about the singers, who they are and where they got the gift of their beautiful voices. And mainly wonder how Ian keeps finding such class tunes!
I&amp;rsquo;m usually floored by at least a couple of songs on each episode.</description>
